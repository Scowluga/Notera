# Overview

Notera is a platform to annotate and bookmark Spotify audio tracks by timestamp. Use it to keep track of your favourite musical moments, save key points in podcasts for later, and share everything with your friends. 

The Notera client is in-progress and built using React. 

The Notera server is built using Go, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, and hosted completely on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and ElastiCache. 

See the [server](https://github.com/Scowluga/Notera/tree/master/server) folder for setup instructions and API documentation.
